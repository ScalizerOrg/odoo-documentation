ECPay Integration

Odoo supports integration with ECPay to submit generated invoices directly to their system. The
:guilabel:`Taiwan - E-invoicing` module (`l10n_tw_edi_ecpay`) is required for this functionality.

Set-up
------

To configure the integration, valid credentials must be retrieved from the
'ECPay vendor backend <https://vendor.ecpay.com.tw/User/LogOn_Step1>`_. The required information
includes:

- :guilabel:`MerchantID`
- :guilabel:`Hashkey`
- :guilabel:`HashIV`

Configuration in Odoo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[cite_start]Open the Accounting app, navigate to the :guilabel:`Taiwan Electronic Invoicing` section, and fill in the :guilabel:`MerchantID`, :guilabel:`HashKey`, and :guilabel:`HashIV` fields. [cite: 15]

.. note::
   [cite_start]For testing purposes, do not use real credentials. [cite: 17] [cite_start]Instead, use the Staging information provided by ECPay (https://developers.ecpay.com.tw/?p=24174) and enable the :guilabel:`Staging mode` field. [cite: 17]

Contacts
--------

[cite_start]In Taiwan, a clear distinction exists between B2B (Business-to-Business) and B2C (Business-to-Consumer) invoices. [cite: 19] [cite_start]This distinction is managed via the Contacts app configuration. [cite: 20]

- [cite_start]**Company (B2B)**: When the customer is a company, select the :guilabel:`Company` option and ensure the :guilabel:`Tax ID` is filled. [cite: 21] [cite_start]The :guilabel:`Email` or :guilabel:`Phone` fields should also be filled in. [cite: 22]
- [cite_start]**Individual (B2C)**: When the customer is an individual, select the :guilabel:`Individual` option. [cite: 23] [cite_start]Provide an :guilabel:`Email` or :guilabel:`Phone` number. [cite: 24]

.. note::
   - [cite_start]An invoice sent to an individual partner belonging to a Company partner is treated as a B2B invoice (associated with the parent Company). [cite: 26]
   - [cite_start]An invoice sent to an individual partner not belonging to a Company is treated as a B2C invoice. [cite: 27]

Taxes
-----

[cite_start]The standard tax rate in Taiwan is 5%, though special tax rates apply to specific industries. [cite: 29] [cite_start]To configure special taxes Gross Business Receipts Tax (GBRT), go to :menuselection:`Accounting --> Configuration --> Taxes` and create a new tax. [cite: 30]

[cite_start]Configure the following: [cite: 31]

- [cite_start]Fill in the standard fields (Tax Name, Tax Type, Tax Computation, Tax Scope). [cite: 32]
- [cite_start]For :guilabel:`Ecpay Tax Type`, select :guilabel:`Taxable (special tax rate)`. [cite: 33]
- [cite_start]A new field, :guilabel:`Ecpay Special Tax Type`, will appear. [cite: 34] [cite_start]Select the applicable industry. [cite: 34]

.. tip::
   [cite_start]**Example**: If "Saloons and tea rooms, coffee shops and bars offering companionship services: Tax rate is 25%" is selected, enter `25` in the Amount field. [cite: 36]
